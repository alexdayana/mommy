In the game teasers, she is seen having four legs, but the latest Game Theory suggests that throughout Chapter 2: Fly in a Web, Mommy will be creating new horrifying limbs for herself out of smaller toys in Playtime Co. This speculation is supported by the various toys caught in Mommy Long Leg's webs around the factory, and most importantly, the doll Poppy Playtime's Mommy is likely based on. The vintage Betty Spaghetty doll that appears to have inspired Mommy featured holes in her arms and legs that allowed her limbs to be interchangeable. These holes appear in Mommy Long Leg's design and may have the same function in Poppy Playtime.As is often the case with mysterious horror games, fan theories are abundant and widespread, especially due to the delay of the upcoming Poppy Playtime Chapter 2. The Game Theorists are responsible for sharing many ideas on the game, including thoughts on Playtime Co. employee experiments and the actual role of the titular doll Poppy. It hasn't been officially confirmed that Mommy Long Legs is the main villain in Fly in a Web, but the developer has placed a heavy focus on the bright prink character, leading many to expect her to play a major role in the next chapter of the game. In the teaser trailer, she refers to the player as a new playmate, and other fan ideas suggest she may be manipulating the player into becoming the next victim trapped in her web.Mommy Long Legs' original name reveal was controversial, as it and a few other lore aspects could only be unlocked via purchasing MOB Games' now-defunct Poppy Playtime NFTs. Fortunately, many content creators purchased the NFTs and shared their content. Despite the controversy, players are still anticipating Poppy Playtime Chapter 2: Fly in a Web's release to discover all there is within Playtime Co.'s walls - and find out the truth about Mommy Long Legs and MatPat's latest theory.
